# RAPIDS Build, Packaging, and Deployment Documentation

This page documents the tools and processes associated with producing RAPIDS libraries.
This is a living document that is intended for DevOps and Ops engineers to keep up-to-date as changes are made.
In addition to documenting current processes for onboarding new members and providing information to non-ops engineers, the hope is that maintaining this documentation will help suss out areas for improvement as well.

Goals:

- To provide a one-stop shop for all information relating to RAPIDS build, packaging, and deployment. If you have a question, it should be possible to find the answer by starting at this document.
- To provide guidance for non-ops engineers who need information to make changes that they need (e.g. adding a custom Github workflow or adding a new package).

Non-goals:

- To be self-contained or exhaustive. There is a lot of great documentation in other forums that this document links to freely. If there is a more appropriate home for a particular piece of information, it should go there, not here.
- To be a "getting started" guide. For that, see the documentation on [devcontainers](link), which are our preferred entrypoint for starting RAPIDS development, or the various CONTRIBUTING guides in each repository.
