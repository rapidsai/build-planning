# FAQ

This page should contain a list of common issues that we run into with RAPIDS builds.
This can range from conda build issues stemming from incorrect run export specification to devcontainer build problems that stem from CMake bugs.
The list may be grown over time and should be written in a way that is useful to both build engineers and other developers who are less familiar with our infrastructure but are attempting to learn enough to debug issues that arise.
